# Problems_CP
	Hello!!! This is a repository to mantain in order all my submissions for different judges like CodeForces, Kattis, CSES, etc. 
	I'm a beginner in competitive programming and I am trying to keep all my submissions in order. If you see a problem here, has an AC :) 
	Feel free to contact me if you have a better way to solve any of the problems in here, I'll be super excited to learn :D
